My PhD focuses on developing and applying advanced statistical models to improve projections of sub-daily extreme precipitation, with significant contributions to both statistical theory and climate modeling. The core of my work involves extending the Max-and-Smooth method by integrating a Matérn-like copula at the data level. This innovation enhances the representation of extremal spatial dependence in climate projections, addressing biases in high-resolution climate models. By bridging spatial statistics and extreme value analysis, my research contributes novel methodologies for bias correction and improved uncertainty quantification in climate projections.

Manuscript 1 – Theoretical Development of the Matérn-like Copula for Max-and-Smooth
In my first paper, I lay the foundation for my PhD by developing the Matérn-like copula and incorporating it into the Max-and-Smooth framework. This work focuses on the mathematical properties of the copula, demonstrating how it captures spatial dependencies in extreme precipitation data. I explore computational techniques such as folded circulant approximations to efficiently handle large spatial grids, presenting theoretical results alongside validation through simulated data.

Manuscript 2 – Application to UKCP Climate Projections and Observed Data
My second manuscript applies the copula-extended Max-and-Smooth model to UKCP climate projections and real observed data from the UK Met Office, analyzing sub-daily precipitation on a 5x5 km grid. My primary objective is to recalibrate UKCP projections by comparing them to observed data, identifying systematic biases, and performing bias corrections through a hierarchical statistical model. The paper emphasizes improving 21st-century projections of extreme precipitation by leveraging all available data, thereby contributing to more reliable hydrological forecasting.

Manuscript 3 – Software Implementation and R Package
In my third paper, I focus on publishing an R package that implements the Max-and-Smooth method with the added copula. Targeting the Journal of Statistical Software, this manuscript highlights the numerical programming, C++ integration, and user interface design necessary to develop scalable and user-friendly tools for spatial extreme value analysis. The package facilitates reproducibility and accessibility, allowing researchers and practitioners to apply the methodology to diverse climate datasets.

This structured progression—from theoretical development to application and software dissemination—reflects my comprehensive approach to addressing challenges in climate modeling and extreme precipitation analysis.
