Modeling spatial dependence through latent Gaussian models with spatial copulas

This research explores an approach to modeling spatial dependence in extreme precipitation data through the integration of latent Gaussian models and spatial copulas. We implement a Mat√©rn-like copula structure within a stepwise inference framework to specifically address data-level spatial dependence that proves challenging for traditional hierarchical modeling approaches. Our method was developed to overcome limitations in conventional spatial models that often struggle to capture the complex data-level spatial dependence structures present in extreme environmental data. By combining Generalized Extreme Value (GEV) marginal distributions with a Gaussian copula transform and employing a precision matrix structure with Kronecker products, we achieve both statistical flexibility and computational efficiency for large spatial datasets. The methodology follows a carefully designed sequence: independent GEV parameter estimation, copula parameter optimization, joint estimation incorporating spatial dependence, and Bayesian spatial smoothing of parameters. Initial applications to UKCP precipitation projections across the UK suggest this approach may offer practical advantages in certain contexts, including coherent spatial patterns in parameter estimates and computational feasibility for high-dimensional datasets. We present these preliminary findings as a contribution to the ongoing development of methods for modeling spatial extremes, with potential applications for improving projections of sub-daily extreme precipitation events.
