# Project Overview

## Presentation Context
This project contains my PhD midterm presentation materials, focusing on improved 21st century projections of sub-daily extreme precipitation. The presentation will cover my current progress and future plans.

## Research Structure
My work is organized into three main manuscripts, currently stored as research papers:

1. Theoretical Development (Mat√©rn-like Copula)
2. Application to UKCP Climate Projections
3. Software Implementation (R Package)

## Key Components in Presentation
The presentation (index.qmd) covers:

1. Background
   - UKCP Local Projections data
   - Spatial modeling challenges
   - GEV parameter estimation

2. Methods
   - Spatial models (CAR, ICAR, BYM, BYM2)
   - Copula-based dependence modeling
   - Computational efficiency considerations

3. Current Results
   - Theoretical framework validation
   - Initial application to UK data
   - Software development progress

4. Future Work
   - Complete validation studies
   - Extend methodology
   - Package documentation and testing

## Technical Details
The presentation uses:
- Quarto/RevealJS for slides
- MathJax for mathematical notation
- Custom SCSS theming
- BibTeX for references

## LLM Assistance Areas
Key areas where LLM support would be valuable:
1. Mathematical notation and equation formatting
2. Technical writing clarity
3. Presentation structure optimization
4. Reference management
5. Code documentation
